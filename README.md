## My process
I started reading the API documentation to understand how to fetch the data and how to use it to show the fields I wanted.
Then started building the homepage with Mobile First approach, I used ContextAPI to change between dark and light mode and for the filtering.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/ptbr/docs/intro) - For fetching the data

### What I learned
With this challenge I learned more about many things like consuming REST APIs, use global styles with styled components, some features of the Next useRouter and React ContextAPI.
